## Getting started

In this hands-on you will learn the AWS IaaS (Infrastructure as a Servie) basis with different services like VPC, EC2,...  

You can perform it through the web UI but you can also use the AWS cli or an IaC tools (CloudFormation/CDK or Terraform).

## What you need

All you need is an AWS account to complete this lab.  
You will need an AWS user to access to the web UI  (Login / password).  
If you chose to use the AWS cli or IaC tools you will need a programatic access (AccessKey / SecretKey) on your account.

## Stack initialization

You can find CDK and Terraform stacks as example in this repository.
