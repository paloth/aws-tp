<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Information</h2>

Security group is a virtual stateful firewall into your VPC. It control inbound and outbound traffic at the resource level.
Stateful means that flow that are allowed inbound are automatically allowed outbound regardless the rules. Same thing for allowed outbound traffic.
You can Allow traffic but not Deny. If a rule does not exist, it is not allowed.

In a rule you can define sources. IP, CIDR block or Security group ID are allowed.
Security group ID as a source allow all the resources attached to the source security group to initiate traffic to the destination security group.

Example:

`sg-xxx0 rules`

| Type  | Protocole | Port Range | Source  |
| ----- | --------- | ---------- | ------- |
| HTTP  | TCP       | 80         | sg-xxx1 |
| HTTPS | TCP       | 443        | sg-xxx2 |

The resources attached to the sg-xxx0 will only accept HTTP traffic from the resources attached to the sg-xxx1 and only accept HTTPS traffic from the resources attached to the security group sg-xxx2.  
If HTTP traffic comes from a resource attached to sg-xxx2 it will be denied by sg-xxx0

<h2 style="font-weight: bold;" align="right">Create Security Groups</h2>

Create 2 Security Groups:

- One named ALB

> Allow HTTP traffic from the world (0.0.0.0/0)

- One named WebSrv

> Allow HTTP from the ALB security (Use the Security group ID)
