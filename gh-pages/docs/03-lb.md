# Load Balancer

## Information about Elastic Load balancing

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets.  
It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.

On AWS, there is three kind of load balancer:

- Application Load Balancer
  - It can directly route HTTP and HTTPS request.
- Network Load Balancer
  - Load balance TCP, UDP and TLS traffic with good performance
- Classic Load Balacer
  - A basic Load balancer
